# Code
**While Loop grading system**

 - Grading System Using While Loop and checking if the input is valid or not. if not; the user will repeat entering the input until the input is valid.  
It also has features that ask you if you want your grade converted to American grade system.
- I did it when i was 1st Year BSCS student. created it using python 3.
